You would need to enable test signing:
	bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON

And reboot the VM to use the driver.

If you want to test the driver you can - register a service (pointing to the .sys file), start it, stop it:

sc create test64 type= kernel binpath="C:\....FULL PATH\test64.sys"
sc start test64
sc stop test64
